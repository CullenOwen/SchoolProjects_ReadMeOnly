# mobile-device-final-egg-timer

This was my final exam for mobile development. In 1 hour I had to create a timer in android studio that highlighted my
ability to work with fragments and show a timer for the user to cook eggs to.

Notes: My timer is bugged slightly as I had chosen a poor widget to impliment.
By the time I had realised my mistake I had very little time left to fix it.
The timer still counts down when paused because it is based on the time the fragment was loaded.
