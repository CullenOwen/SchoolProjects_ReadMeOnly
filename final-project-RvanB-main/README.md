# CSCI 412 Final Project - Caffeinated

Authors: Raiden van Bronkhorst, Steven Marantz, Cullen Owen

This project was created remotely Spring 2021.

In this project my team and I created an app that allowed users to track caffeine intake through either manual inputs or by scaning a bar code and making API calls to find the caffeine of a certain item.
