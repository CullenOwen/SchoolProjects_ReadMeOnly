With a partner we created code that would do the following:

Add, delete, and show from a database
Show
  - Runs querys to show either all employees within a certain department or a total sum of all payouts within the last year
Delete
  - Runs a query to delete an employee with a specific emp_no
Add
  - Runs querys to add an employee to a database.
Main
  - takes user input in a specific format and runs sql querys on it.
