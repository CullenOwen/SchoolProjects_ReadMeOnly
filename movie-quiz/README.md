# Homework 3 Movie Quiz

Taken from the assignment description:

When the app is launched, it randomly chooses a question from the database of questions, and displays the question on the screen. The user is supposed to choose True or False for the quiz. 

If the user chooses correctly, the app displays a Toast that says "Correct!". If the user chooses wrongly, the app displays a Toast that says "Wrong!"

If the user presses the Reload button, the app loads a random new question.
